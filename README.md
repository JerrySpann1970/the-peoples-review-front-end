## Overview
Not everyone makes purchases at Walmart or Amazon. That's why we're
building the Peoples Review, an open and inclusive place for shoppers
to share their products, and their honest and open opinion about them.
We provide a platform and the people share their purchases without
having to log in to numerous e-commerce sites.  All the reviews in one
place is the Peoples Review.
