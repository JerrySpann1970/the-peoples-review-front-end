              Not everyone makes purchases at Walmart or Amazon. That's why we're
              building the Peoples Review, an open and inclusive place for shoppers
              to share their products, and their honest and open opinion about them.
              We provide a platform and the people share their purchases without
              having to log in to numerous e-commerce sites.  All the reviews in one
              place is the Peoples Review.

              I found the Peoples Review through a friend of mine, and I'm so 
              glad I did. As a consumer that shops at my local businesses, I 
              can not leave reviews for products on Amazon or other online retailers.
              Writing reviews on the Peoples Review is easy and convenient.
